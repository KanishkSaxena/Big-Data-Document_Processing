# Big-Data Project 
created with Java, Apache spark
Processes 15 GB data with  ~ 58 sec

Developed a batch-based text search and filtering pipeline in Apache Spark. The core objective of this pipeline was to process large collection of text documents and a set of user-defined queries, resulting in the retrieval of the top 10 documents. This was achieved by implementing tokenization, utilizing a ranking model and resolving duplicates based on textual distance in document titles (using a provided comparison function).
